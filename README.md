# Digit Recognition Neural Network  

This project implements a **digit recognition system** using a **neural network** with a sigmoid activation function and **logistic regression** for the output layer. It includes a **cost function**, a **gradient function**, and an optimization step using the **fmincg algorithm**.  

## Features  
✅ Train a new neural network for digit recognition  
✅ Load a **pretrained** neural network model  
✅ Predict a **random digit** from the dataset  
✅ Uses **gradient descent** and **regularization** for optimization  

## How It Works  
1. The program either **trains a new model** from scratch or **loads a pretrained model**.  
2. Once loaded, it selects a **random digit** from the dataset.  
3. The neural network predicts the digit based on its learned weights.  

## Programming Language and Algorithms

- **Algorithms:**  
  - **Cost Function:** Logistic regression cost function
  - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid function  
  - **Optimization Algorithm:** fmincg optimization  
  - **Training Algorithm:** Backpropagation with gradient descent
